The goal of this project is to analyze data from Goodreads (https://www.goodreads.com/), with a focus on books of the Fantasy genre. I will aim to retrieve insights such as:

- Are specific sub-genres (epic, dark, romance) rated higher?
- Does publication year affect ratings?
- Do longer fantasy books get higher ratings?
- How did the ratings/views change over the last few years?

I will then aim to build an ML model (random forest) that predicts book popularity based on features of:
 - number of pages (numeric)
 - publication year (numeric)
 - genre (categorical)
 - publisher (categorical)
 - language (categorical).

 The data used in this exercise will be downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/middlelight/goodreadsbookswithgenres). It includes information about genre, publisher, average review, etc.
